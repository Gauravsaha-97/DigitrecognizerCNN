# Digit Recognizer Using CNN

## About
in this project, I have tried to implement a 2 Layered Convolution Neural Netrowk using Tensorflow. Previously, i have tried to implement the same using Decision Tree Classifier and got an accuracy of 88%. Using 2-Layered CNN, I got accuracy of 99%.
The dataset can be found in the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/)
